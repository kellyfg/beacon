# I have/I need platform

ðŸš¨This is **PRE-ALPHA** and not yet ready for use ðŸš¨

This is a tool for local authorities and voluntary organisations to record and triage the needs of vulnerable people in their jurisdiction, and assign those needs to those who can meet them.

It's a rails app backed by a postgresql database.

## Running it locally

```
git clone https://github.com/wearefuturegov/i-have-i-need
bundle install

# install javascript dependencies
yarn install

# launch postgres server via docker
docker-compose up -d

# run create databases, run migrations and seeds
rails db:setup

rails server
```

It'll be on **localhost:3000**.
    
### How emails work
When running in development mode, emails are sent to [maildev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/maildev), running via `docker-compose`.

Visit **localhost:1080** to view sent emails.

## Running it on the web
