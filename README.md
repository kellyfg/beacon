# I have/I need platform

ðŸš¨This is **PRE-ALPHA** and not yet ready for use ðŸš¨

This is a platform for local authorities and voluntary organisations to manage demand and supply of community services during the coronavirus pandemic.

It's a rails app backed by a postgresql database.

## Running it locally

```
git clone https://github.com/wearefuturegov/i-have-i-need
bundle install

# install javascript dependencies
yarn install

# launch postgres server via docker
docker-compose up -d

# run create databases, run migrations and seeds
rails db:setup

rails server
```

It'll be on localhost:3000.
    
### How emails work
When running in development mode, emails are sent to maildev, running via docker-compose

Visit localhost:1080 to view sent emails

## Running it on the web
