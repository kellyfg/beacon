Feature: Add needs
  As a Call centre agent
  I want to add multiples needs to a person
  So that I can confirm details with people on the phone as their needs are identified

  Call centre manager: 200 new vulnerable people have been added to the list from online referrals,
  I need to *see what my staff are currently working on*
  so I know who has capacity and then have a way to divide and assign the new cases to my staff

  Service manager: 50 new referrals have come through to the emergency food service,
  I need to *know who is a priority (e.g. needs food today)*
  so I can prioritise assigning these cases to my team

  Call centre agent: I need to *know how I refer my calls or who I assign tasks to,
  e.g. Food service manager, ASC (not just people's names but their roles)*

  Call centre agent: As I'm confirming a residents details on the phone they
  begin telling me about whats going on in their life and I'm identifying some needs,
  I need to *easily be able to capture this without flicking back
  and forward between the tabs and having to save the page each time*

  Background:
    * I am logged into the system

  Scenario Outline: Add any needs
    Given a resident
    When I add needs "<need>"
    And I submit the add needs form
    Then the residents list of needs contains "<need>"
    Examples:
